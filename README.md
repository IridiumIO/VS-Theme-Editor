Allows editing of `.pkgdef` themes for Visual Studio 2022. 

- Modify existing color keys in any category within the theme
- Add new categories (right-click in the left sidebar, click `Add`)
- Add new color keys (scroll to the bottom of the color list and type new keys into the bottom row)
- Allows direct testing of themes in Visual Studio (requires running as Admin however, due to the pkgdef theme being generated and copied into the Visual Studio directory)

Installed themes can be found in the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\17.0_ab1ff52e\Extensions\` folder.
